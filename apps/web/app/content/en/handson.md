At Vue Fes Japan, we hold a hands-on workshop every year for those who want to start learning Vue.js!

Nuxt, the meta-framework of Vue.js, has an official tutorial called [Nuxt Tutorial](https://github.com/nuxt/learn.nuxt.com) currently under development. This time, in collaboration with its author [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) and Vue Fes Japan, we will release this official tutorial in Japanese in advance and use it as the subject of our hands-on workshop.

This tutorial starts with the basics of Vue.js (reactivity, Composition API, etc.) and aims to help understand the core concepts of Nuxt. It is designed for Vue.js beginners who have never used Vue.js but want to create practical applications with it.

Advance registration is required to participate. When purchasing a general ticket, please also apply for a hands-on ticket (free). Seats are limited and available on a first-come, first-served basis, so please apply early!
