At Vue Fes Japan 2024, we will conduct hands-on sessions where participants can experience Vue.js application development by actively writing code together (a style of learning where you learn by actually coding).

From beginners who are interested in learning Vue.js for the first time to experienced developers who want to catch up on the new development methods of Vue 3, you can master the basics of Vue.js in just 2 hours. Additionally, there will be Q&A sessions hosted by Vue.js Japan User Group staff.

Pre-registration is required to participate. When purchasing general tickets, please also apply for a hands-on ticket (free of charge). Seats are limited and allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, so please register early!
