In order to make Vue Fes Japan 2024 a better conference where people involved in Vue.js gather, we are looking for sponsors. Please refer to the materials for detailed information such as sponsorship plans.

The first round of applications has now closed, and a second round of applications will begin soon, as there are still openings in some plans. Companies that have already been selected for the first round of applications can still apply for additional plans.
Specific details will be announced on the official website and the official X account ([@vuefes](https://x.com/vuefes){:target=“\_blank”}).
