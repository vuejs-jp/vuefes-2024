Want to be a speaker at Vue Fes Japan 2024?

Share your unique knowledge and experience of Vue and its ecosystem with the rest of Japan at one of the largest Vue.js conferences in Japan.

Vue Fes Japan 2024 will use the CFP (Call for Papers) system to solicit speaker presentations from the general public, and the Vue Fes Japan 2024 Organizing Committee will make a selection of the submissions to be used as the official sessions.

Two presentation formats are available: a 30-minute "Session" and a 5-minute "Lightning Talk (LT)".

We are looking forward to hearing your passionate presentation on your love of Vue!
