At Vue Fes Japan, we conduct hands-on sessions every year for those who are just starting to learn Vue.js!

Nuxt, the meta-framework for Vue.js, has an official tutorial called [Nuxt Tutorial](https://github.com/nuxt/learn.nuxt.com) currently under development. This time, in collaboration with [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu), the author of this tutorial, Vue Fes Japan will debut the Japanese version of this official tutorial in advance, using it as the material for our hands-on sessions.

This tutorial starts with the basics of Vue.js (reactivity, Composition API, etc.) and aims to help beginners who have never touched Vue.js but want to create practical applications with it. It covers core concepts of Nuxt and is designed to be enjoyable for those new to Vue.js who are eager to try their hand at building applications.
