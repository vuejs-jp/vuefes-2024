Vue Fes Japan, the largest Vue.js conference in Japan, will be held again in 2024!

This conference, born in 2018, was created to celebrate Vue.js together like a festival, to learn together, and above all, to enjoy together.

The last Vue Fes Japan 2023 was the first offline event in 5 years and was attended by nearly 600 people. After a long period of cancellations and online events, the enthusiasm of the Vue.js community was palpable at this conference.

Vue.js has been steadily evolving since Vue 3 became the default in January 2022. The latest 3.4 series has seen 4.8 million downloads per week, major framework libraries such as Nuxt, Vuetify, and Quasar have completed their support for Vue 3, and the entire ecosystem has entered a period of stability.

Meanwhile, a new trend is emerging in the ecosystem around Vue.js.

Nitro, Nuxt's core server engine, is starting to be used by other metaframeworks such as SolidStart and Analog. UnJS, a collection of high-quality JavaScript utilities, has gained traction in the non-Vue.js community, and Vite, created by Vue.js author Evan You, has evolved into a next-generation tool that supports a wide variety of front-ends beyond Vue, with over 11 million weekly downloads.

In addition, we are working with the Rspack team and the OXC project to develop Rolldown, a Rust implementation of the Vite core rollup, releasing an initial version in March 2024, and other open source software around Vue.js is far reaching.

This year's Vue Fes Japan 2024 is the place to experience the latest trends. Please join us at the conference and enjoy the experience that only the real thing can offer!

Be More Collaboration! Be More Expansion!
