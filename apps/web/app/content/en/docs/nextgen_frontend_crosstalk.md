Did you know that there's been a growing trend in implementing JavaScript ecosystems using Rust? Examples include [Oxc](https://oxc.rs/), [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/), [Turbo](https://turbo.build/), [Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev/), [SWC](https://swc.rs/), and others adopting Rust. Additionally, there's an ongoing project to reimplement [Rollup](https://rolldown.rs/), used in the Vue.js ecosystem through Vite, in Rust.

Will Rust become mainstream in frontend development going forward? And will existing JavaScript-based ecosystems eventually be reimplemented in Rust?

In this session, we'll invite contributors from the JavaScript OSS community to join Evan You and Boshen Chen, our international guest speakers, for a cross-talk discussion on the future direction of JavaScript ecosystems.
