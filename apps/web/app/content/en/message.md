Vue Fes Japan is Japan's largest Vue.js conference, established in 2018.

Literally, Vue Fes was born to liven up Vue.js together like a festival, to learn together, and above all, to enjoy together.

Last year, in 2022, it was held online due to the prolonged corona disaster, and it was a lot of fun with over 650 pre-registrations and over 10,000 views. In particular, it was impressive that there were many contents related to migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3.

In January 2022, Vue.js defaulted to its latest version, Vue 3. As a result, the number of downloads on npm has increased by over 200%, accelerating the adoption of Vue 3. In the ecosystem, Nuxt 3 and Vuetify 3, which support Vue 3, were released in November 2022.

While the use of Vue 3 is gaining momentum, Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, is also working on the next Vue.js. Just as Vite, which he developed, was released not only to the Vue.js community but also to other JavaScript communities, he is also trying to show new developments in the ecosystem such as Nuxt and Volar.

As Vue.js and the ecosystem continue to develop, we have decided to reboot Vue Fes Japan as an offline conference in 2023.

By all means, let's participate in the conference together and enjoy an experience that can only be experienced in real life!
